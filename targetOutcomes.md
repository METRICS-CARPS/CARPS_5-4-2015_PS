# Target Outcomes
## Article ID: 5-4-2015 PS

For this article you should focus on the findings reported in the results section of Experiment 6.

Specifically, you should attempt to reproduce all descriptive and inferential analyses reported in the text below and associated tables/figures:

> One participant was excluded because of a computer
malfunction during the game. Time-rich participants
rated the loss as more expensive when they thought
about a small account (M = 8.31, 95% CI = [7.78, 8.84])
than when they thought about a large account (M = 6.50,
95% CI = [5.42, 7.58]), whereas time-poor participants’
evaluations did not differ between the small-account
condition (M = 8.33, 95% CI = [7.14, 9.52]) and the large account
condition (M = 8.83, 95% CI = [7.97, 9.69]). A 2
(scarcity condition) × 2 (account condition) analysis of
variance revealed a significant interaction, F(1, 69) = 5.16,
p < .05, ηp2 = .07.
